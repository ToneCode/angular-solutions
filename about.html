					<h3>About me, and why I started the journey to DevOps</h3>
					<p>During a 22 hour flight from San Francisco to Cochin, India. I knew I would need something to pass the
						time,
						so I brought several books along for the ride. Why India, well for one I have always dreamed of
						visiting
						India and lets face it I'm not getting any younger. Also second to the US, India offers some of the
						most
						advanced IT training courses in the world. When I'm on vacation I always try to find a training course
						for
						professional enrichment, so I located a company teaching the official RedHat linux training course. My
						feeling
						is by taking RedHat linux training it would help me with a career transition from healthcare into the
						world of
						technology. My background includes working in Telecommunications with Verizon, primarly in the
						DataCenter doing
						tier II support with Lucent and Cisco systems equipment. Linux training would round out my operations
						expertise.</p>
					<p>After settling into the flight, I grabbed a book to read titled "The Phoenix Project", now before
						reading it
						I thought it was going to be lots of war stories about various projects the team had worked on,
						instead it
						described the evolution of the IT department in a company that was on the verge of complete failure.
						In a
						fast-paced and entertaining style, the three visionaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that
						anyone
						who has worked in IT would recognize as it had me glued to my seat. This book has been the single
						reason
						that I'm pursuing a career in DevOps.</p>
					<h3>Embrace DevOps, or get left behind</h3>
					<p>Over the past four years, the Puppet Labs State of DevOps Report has shed more light on DevOps, IT
						performance and organizational performance than any other research of its kind based on responses from
						over 20,000 tech professionals worldwide.</p>
					<h3>Findings from the 2015 State of DevOps Report:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							High-performing IT organizations experience 60X fewer failures and recover from failure 168X faster
							than their lower-performing peers. They also deploy 30X more frequently with 200X shorter lead
							times.
						</li>
						<li>Lean management and continuous delivery practices create the conditions for delivering value
							faster, sustainably.
						</li>
						<li>High performance is achievable no matter if your apps are greenfield, brownfield or legacy.</li>
						<li>DevOps initiatives launched solely by C-level executives or from the grassroots are less likely to
							succeed.
						</li>
						<li>IT managers play a critical role in promoting diversity and limiting burnout.</li>
					</ul>

				<p>Companies that incorporate DevOps practices get more done, plain and simple. They deploy code up to 30
					times more frequently than their competition. And less than 50% of their deployments fail according to
					Puppet Labs 2015 State of DevOps survey.
					The biggest shift in attitude within a DevOps environment is that there is one team composed of
					cross-functional team members including developers, QA, DBAs, business analysts, operations engineers and
					so forth. Collaboration across these different roles can now deliver many benefits.</p>
				<p>Communication advocated by DevOps means that everyone involved work together to clearly define the code's
					purpose and requirements. DevOps also reduces the number of hand-offs, which cause delays and wasted
					effort. Your confidence in the
					software's functionality and stability increases as the code moves through the pipeline. By the time you
					reach the final production stage, you know you can safely release your latest feature, improvement or bug
					fix to the world.</p>
