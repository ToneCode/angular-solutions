						<h2>About Me</h2>
					   <h3>Embrace DevOps, or get left behind</h3>
						<p>Over the past four years, the Puppet Labs State of DevOps Report has shed more light on DevOps, IT performance and organizational performance than any other research of its kind â€” based on responses from over 20,000 tech professionals worldwide.</p>
						<h3>Findings from the 2015 State of DevOps Report:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
						High-performing IT organizations experience 60X fewer failures and recover from failure 168X faster than their lower-performing peers. They also deploy 30X more frequently with 200X shorter lead times.</li>
						  <li>Lean management and continuous delivery practices create the conditions for delivering value faster, sustainably.</li>
						  <li>High performance is achievable no matter if your apps are greenfield, brownfield or legacy.</li>
						  <li>DevOps initiatives launched solely by C-level executives or from the grassroots are less likely to succeed.</li>
						  <li>IT managers play a critical role in promoting diversity and limiting burnout.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Companies that incorporate DevOps practices get more done, plain and simple. They deploy code up to 30 times more frequently than their competition. And less than 50% of their deployments fail according to Puppet Labs 2015 State of DevOps survey.
						The biggest shift in attitude in a DevOps environment is that there is one team composed of cross-functional team members including developers, QA, DBAs, business analysts, operations engineers and so forth. Collaboration across these different roles delivers many benefits.</p>
					<p>Communication advocated by DevOps means that everyone involved work together to clearly define the code's purpose and requirements. DevOps also reduces the number of hand-offs, which cause delays and wasted effort.
						Technologically, you need an automated deployment pipeline. You can think of the pipeline as a series of stages, or quality gates, that each run automated tests whenever you make a change to your code. When software passes the tests in one stage, it is promoted to the next stage. Your confidence in the software's functionality and stability increases as the code moves through the pipeline. By the time you reach the final production stage, you know you can safely release your latest feature, improvement or bug fix to the world.</p>
