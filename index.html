				<h1>Enterprise capabilities for continuous software delivery</h1>
				<p class="lead">.When your Ops folks start thinking about development and your Dev folks starting thinking about Operations, you have a single team that works together with continuous development, continuous testing and continuous deployments.</p>

					<h2>DevOps</h2>
					<p class="text-danger">
					<p>Companies that embrace the DevOps have more frequent deploys, which allows them to introduce new features more often in a more stable environment. The typical tension between Development and Operations is gone and everyone is more effective.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
					<p>The phrase continuous integration (CI) came out of the Extreme Programming process and was one of its original guidelines. Essentially, developers integrate their code into the code repository at least once a day (and preferably more often). Without continuous integration, the odds of one developer’s changes conflicting with another developer’s changes are very high. When long periods of time go by without integration, the problems that surface can be huge and costly to track down and fix.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
					<p>Continuous deployment is the next step of continuous delivery: Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically. Continuous deployment should be the goal of most companies that are not constrained by regulatory or other requirements.</p>
